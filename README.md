# Python Image Recognition Bots

Welcome to the Python Image Recognition Bots repository. This collection of scripts demonstrates image recognition techniques using Python and the `pyautogui` library.

## Scripts Overview

### AimBooster Automation

The AimBooster Automation script uses `pyautogui` to simulate mouse clicks based on pixel color patterns. It continuously scans a specified region, identifying colors, and clicking accordingly.

**Customization:**
Adjust the region coordinates, pixel colors, and click timings in the script based on the specific requirements of the AimBooster game.

### Region Screenshot

The Region Screenshot script captures a screenshot of a specified region on the screen using `pyautogui` and saves it as a PNG file. It's a utility script for capturing specific areas of interest.

**Customization:**
Adjust the region coordinates in the script to capture a different area on the screen.

### Piano Tiles Automation

The Piano Tiles Automation script is designed to automate actions in a game similar to "Piano Tiles" using Python and `pyautogui`. It automatically identifies and clicks on black-colored tiles in a piano-like grid.

**Customization:**
Adjust the tile positions, pixel colors, and click timings in the script based on the specific characteristics of the game.

### Stickman Image Recognition

The Stickman Image Recognition script uses `pyautogui` to search for a stickman image on the screen within a specified region. It continuously checks for the stickman image and prints messages based on its presence.

**Customization:**
Adjust the region coordinates in the script based on the specific area of the screen where you expect the stickman image to appear.
